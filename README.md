<h2>Emílio Website</h2>
<h3><b>What is it?</b></h3>
<p>The Emílio Website was my first web project, developed as an exercise for the Alura course and proposed as an evaluation. The website features a section called "School," where the history of the school is presented. The "Students" section provides some information about the students in the class.</p>
