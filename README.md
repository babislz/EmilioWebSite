<h3>Emílio Website</h3>
<h4><i><b>Objective</b></i></h4>
<p>The Emílio Website was my first web project, developed as an exercise for the Alura course and proposed as an evaluation. The website features a section called "School," where the history of the school is presented. The "Students" section provides some information about the students in the class.</p>
